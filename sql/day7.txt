day 7

I worked on another project - portfolio-ui
making it reponsive for all screens

I also learnt how to use the `order by` keyword
to filter result-set in ascending or descending order.

syntax :

        SELECT column1, column2, ...
        FROM table_name
        ORDER BY column1, column2, ... ASC|DESC;

and how to use the `insert into` statement to insert data into a table

syntax :
        INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3, ...)
        VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...);
